# RUGBE: Really Unfinished Game Boy Emulator

Eventually, it will stand for something else :)

Current state of the emulator:
 - The CPU is nearly completed, just a few more instructions need to be implemented.
 - Stepping through my emulator with GDB and BGB's debugger with the bootstrap ROM, the instructions seem to be executed identically.
 - The display isn't working. I do not believe the error is in the SDL code, but somewhere in the PPU model.
 - Timing is not set up.
